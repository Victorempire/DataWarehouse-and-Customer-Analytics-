# Data Warehouse & Analytics Project 🚀
Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository!  

This project demostrates the design and implementation of a two-layer SQL Data Warehouse (Bronze & Silver) for a digital subscription business operating multiple acquisition channels. The repository showcases the full analytics workflow from raw data ingestion to exploratory data analysis (EDA), providing actionable insights to inform marketing, retention, and revenue strategies.
# Business Context
The company operates a hybrid digital subscription model, offering recurring subscriptions alongside one-off digital products. Between 2020–2025, rapid growth has been achieved through diverse acquisition channels, including Paid Search, Paid Social, Email, Affiliate, Organic, Referral, Direct, Influencer, Display, and Partnerships.
Despite growth, there is limited visibility into:
- Channel efficiency and ROI
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) relative to Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Retention patterns and repeat purchase behavior
- Campaign performance
The purpose of this project is to quantify, interpret, and visualize key business insights, enabling data-driven marketing and product decisions.
 # 🏗️ Data Architecture
 This project applies Medallion Architecture concepts, with two implemented layers (Bronze and Silver) forming the current data warehouse structure.

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization,normalization processes to prepare data for analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis.
